#Web Calculator Answers
1) Identify the component of this assignment that you did the best on, and why. 
    1 Answer) It's hard to say but I think the HTML portion. It made the most sense to me and was easiest to research when I felt stuck.
2) Describe in plain English what problem this assignment was posing, and what your solution was to it.  
    2 Answer) The problem I faced was creating a functioning and interactive caclulator. My solution was lots of YouTube.
3) What was your approach or process?  
    3 Answer) First I tried to get as far as possible without getting help. Then when I was stuck I received help from Alex and reading Mohamed's code while going through it with Alex. After we ran out of time I re-visited the slides from class and watched YouTube videos and read online articles for assistance. 
4) What were your challenges?  
    4 Answer) It was all fairly challenging but I'm struggling the most with GitHub (pushing, pull requests, merging, etc.) and JavaScript. I kept thinking I figured out how to make the calculator work but I was going around in circles. At one point I deleted my JavaScript and started from scratch looking for a different approach.
5) What resources did you use?   
    5 Answer) Everything I could. I used the slides, the TCs, YouTube, JSfiddle & freecodecamp.org.
